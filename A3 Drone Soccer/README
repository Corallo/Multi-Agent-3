In order to get our script to run:

	- include UnityBehaviourTree in the Scripts folder
	- replace DroneAISoccer_red.cs
	- add "new_AI_gr2.id = i % 3;" to line 155 in GameManagerSoccer
	
This works for the red team only, since the Context of the Behaviour Tree has a DroneAISoccer_red object that is used.
